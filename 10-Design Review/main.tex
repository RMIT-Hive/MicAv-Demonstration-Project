\section{Introduction}

    This report outlines the design, prototyping, testing and validation for a basic passive avionics unit.
    The avionics unit is outfitted with a pressure sensor that can be used to calculate the altitude of the aeronautical system it is integrated to.

\section{Requirements}

    The requirements of this avionics unit are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unit shall possess a datalogging ('telemetry') capability:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Telemetry shall record altitude with respect to time.
            \item Telemetry shall store recorded data in nonvolatile memory.
            \item Telemetry shall perform in "L1" unguided rocket flight conditions, including:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Up to 40 g of acceleration
                \item Up to 340 m/s of velocity
                \item Up to 1,500 m of altitude
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    Altitude data is usually the most interesting bit of flight data for a small unguided rocket, as it will validate the trajectory simulation used to design the rocket.
    The avionics unit will store the altitude data to be examined once the unit is recovered;
    This might equate to an analysis of the maximum altitude of a rocket after it has been recovered.
    The altitude data must be in nonvolatile memory so that if the avionics unit runs out of power the data is not lost.
    Otherwise, this altitude data may be recorded and stored in whatever implementation (i.e. method) works.

\section{Detailed Design}

    \subsection{Altitude Measurement}

        There are two types of sensors that can be used for measuring the altitude of the unit; a GPS or a pressure sensor.

        The Global Position System works by triangulating the position of a GPS unit using the Global Navigation Satellite System, by measuring the errors in transmission/reception of GNSS signals.
        A GPS is able to measure altitude as well as position on the surface of the Earth, as long as it has four or more sattelites acquired.
        GPS units have an in-built acceleration and velocity limit (GPS "CoCom" limits) so they cannot be used in guided missile systems.
        The CoCom limit is typically quoted as applying to systems above:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item >60,000 ft (>18.3 km)
            \item >1,000 knots (>514 m/s)
        \end{itemize}
        GPS systems may be specified for greater limits (e.g. U-Blox NEO-6 is specified to operate up to 50km \cite{ublox-gps1}) but it should be assumed that the CoCom limits be applied to all GPS units above the altitude OR velocity limit unless otherwise tested.

        A small number of low-cost (<AUD 60 for breakout) GPS units were examined;
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CD-PA1616S GPS patch antenna module (sold in breakouts by Adafruit) \cite{cd-gps}.
            \item NEO-6 U-blox 6 GPS module (sold in breakouts by U-Blox) \cite{ublox-gps1}.
            \item SAM-M8Q U-blox M8 GNSS antenna module (sold in breakouts by SparkFun) \cite{ublox-gps2}.
        \end{itemize}

        The CoCom limits are not too much for a small ('L1') unguided rocket, but the acceleration limit is.
        These three GPS sensors have an acceration limit of 4 g or greater.
        If this limit is exceeded, the GPS may be disabled for a period of time.
        Therefore, a GPS likely is not an acceptable method for altitude measurement in a rocket.

    \section{Program Logic}

        The program was implemented as a state machine rather than using a branching flowchart.
        State machines may have different defined states, but can only be in one of them at a time.
        State machines move ('transition') between different state only when a particular event occurs or a condition is met.
        Because any given line of state machine code only needs to handle one defined state, it is less likely for weird edge conditions to occur, and therefore the complexity of the code is reduced.
        The state machine code can easily be reset to a known state in the case of an error.
        Finally, it is easy to define when external data is sampled, mitigating the risk for race conditions in non interrupt-based code.
        This is a little weird but I'll explain it below using psuedocode and state machine diagrams.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics{02-Images/avionics state machine.png}
            \caption{Micro-Avionics basic state machine (roughly following UML standard for state machines).}
            \label{fig:micav-basic-state-machine}
        \end{figure}

        Figure \ref{fig:micav-basic-state-machine} presents a state machine that handles the basic functionality of the system.
        There are three states represented by rounded rectangles, with a number of (one-direction) transitions between them.
        The state machine is entered via the labelled black circle.
        Below is a summary of these states;
        \begin{description}
            \item [INIT] Configure the sensors and check for a conformation. The system may enter this state when powering on, or if it needs to reset any sensors.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Initialisation complete}: If the correct conformation is received from the sensors, transition to \textbf{WAIT FOR INPUT} state.
            \end{itemize}
            \item [WAIT FOR INPUT] Do nothing, and wait for the system to be ready for operation.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Ready to collect data}: If the system is ready for operation, transition to \textbf{RECORD DATA} state. The 'ready' check may be optional if the system has no means of performing it in a reliable way. This would lead to an automatic transition out of this state
                \item \textbf{Error detected}: If there is any failure in communicating with sensors, return to the \textbf{INIT} state.
            \end{itemize}
            \item [RECORD DATA] Collect sensor data at regular intervals. Save the sensor data to non-volatile memory.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Error detected}: If there is any failure in communicating with sensors, return to the \textbf{INIT} state.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{description}

        There are many ways to structure a state machine in code.
        Generally for state machines, there is a trade-off between application scalability (e.g. increasing the number of states, or using hierarchical states) and ease of development.
        While the state machine framework is itself infinitely scalable, the most complex state machines are impossible to write by hand - they were intended to be generated by computers.
        If you are handwriting the code, you can get away with writing a flat (non-hierarchical) state machine with less than 10 states.
        Significantly more than this (i.e. 20, 30...), and you may want to consider simplifying your state machine or looking into code generation tools.
        Below is some psuedocode we can use for our state machine application;
        \begin{verbatim}
Define state variable // this may be an enumerated list
Perform any CPU configuration

LOOP
    Sleep for specified time // e.g. 2 seconds between loop
    Initialise/reset any variables
    Check the state variable and jump to relevant state code (STATE 1, STATE 2, etc...)
ENDLOOP

STATE 1
    take input data (e.g. sensor stuff)
    do state code
    make any necessary transitions
STATE 1 END (go back to loop)

STATE 2
    take input data (e.g. sensor stuff)
    do state code
    make any necessary transitions
STATE 2 END (go back to loop)

... etc ...
        \end{verbatim}
        This is a very basic state machine that performs the minimum functionality that is needed.
        For those nerds; this is a flat state machine that does not implement entry/exit conditions and takes input data in a synchronous manner.
